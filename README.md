In decisions from experience, people draw sequential samples from options to learn about their latent payoff distributions (ecological search). 
However, the samples do not give people direct access to the distributions’ properties, but they need to actively process the samples to form a cognitive representation of the payoff distributions (cognitive search). 
The cost of this cognitive search increases with the complexity of the choice options, and people might therefore adapt their ecological search to organize the samples (e.g., in terms of switching more or less frequently between the options) in a way that facilitates the forming of the representation such that it subserves the decision maker’s goal (e.g., choosing the option with better short-term vs. long-term rewards). 
In an experimental study, we instructed people to either choose the option with better short-term vs. long-term rewards and also varied the complexity of the choice problem.
